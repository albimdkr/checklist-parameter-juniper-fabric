Automation generate some output from SSH Juniper to XLSX  
only if all required commands is inserted  
this is just a raw script as template or sample case if I want to create another function  
basically it is SSH automation using paramiko that support multiple command and it is connected via jumphost or bastion  
if you use this script, make sure remove db.json, report.csv, and report.xlsx before running the script   
this script is automatically update the report.xlsx based on db.json within the timestamp when you run
